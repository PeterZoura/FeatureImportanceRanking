This project is a group assignment for the advanced AI course at the University of Windsor.\
We decided to discover whether we can train a neural network to accurately predict the strength of a password based on its features,\
then examine the first vector of the neural network to see which features have higher weight as a way of ranking feature importance.\
We also used other feature importance ranking methods and we discovered that examining the weights of a neural network is not effective.\
